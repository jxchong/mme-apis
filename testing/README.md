# Test data

This test data was compiled by Lijia Huang (CHEO Hospital), Bailey Gallinger (SickKids), and Orion Buske (University of Toronto/SickKids).

There are two files containing test data:

    * `fhs.json`: a small sample data set of 5 patients with Floating-Harbor Syndrome
    * `test.json`: a benchmark data set of 50 test patients compiled from the literature

Both test files contain a JSON-formatted list of patient objects, suitable for loading into a database or including in a match request.
